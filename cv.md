#### ABOUT MYSELF

I've been working as an economist for 7 years. It's quite a long period and I became a little bored. So I've decided to change my career to a frontend developer. Nowadays I have lots of soft skills and just need to keep on working on hard skills. I've got my basic knowledge of development from university, and been practicing in development on VBA and Python just to make my work a little more efficient. I'm very interested in how different things in websites work so I've started my way of studing as frontend developer a few months ago.

#### CODE EXAMPLE

__Credit card mask KATA from CODEWARS__:
Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.

Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.

```javascript
function maskify(cc) {
  let input_array = [];
    let result = String;
    input_array = Array.from(cc);
    
    const input_length = input_array.length;
    
    if (input_length >= 4) {
        for (let i = 0; i<=(input_length-5); i++) {
            input_array.splice(i, 1, "#");   
        }
    }
       else {
           result = input_array.toString();
           result = result.replace(/[',']/g, '');
           return result;
       } 
    result = input_array.toString();
    result = result.replace(/[',']/g, '');
    return result;
}
```
